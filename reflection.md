- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

My initial impressions of Inheritance are that it's very useful for cutting out unecessary or repetitive parts of the code. For example, not having to write the error checking parts of each constructor for the building types cuts down on unecessary repetition when making the different building types. I think that because the building class which all our other classes extend is very simple, it feels a little less helpful than a larger example with more borrowed methods might feel, so I look forward to experimenting with it more in the next assignment. I imagine that it will be very useful in code where there are many moving parts that build off of one another or that have subtle differences that we don't want to waste lines of code on building. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that it went well overall, but I am definitely a little unsure of my method for selling and restocking the supplies. I tried to set it up such that the supplies never it 0, but stay at least a little above it. While the method seems to work how I intended it to, it feels a little clunky. I would tell someone taking this class to try many different versions of the same method to get a feel for how you want your program to run all together. I tried several different versions and the one I settled on was the closest to what I wanted, and it was helpful to be able to compare all the methods together and make minor changes or combine certain approaches.
